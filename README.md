# PREDICT_ADMISSION_OF_COVID-19_CASES
In response to the global pandemic declaration by the WHO, we recognized the need for enhanced personal protection and efficient healthcare management. The escalating number of COVID-19 cases highlighted challenges in maintaining responsive healthcare systems. To address critical patient treatment issues and prevent overwhelming medical resources, we developed a predictive system using advanced machine learning techniques.

Our goal is to refine ICU management by accurately assessing patient severity. Through the analysis of extensive data from severe COVID-19 cases, we devised a prediction system. This system evaluates incoming patient data to swiftly determine ICU admission necessity. By employing optimized machine learning methods, we achieve high accuracy and minimize processing time.

This project presents a solution to expedite and enhance ICU admission decisions. Hospitals can benefit from precise predictions, enabling prompt and targeted patient care. As a result, medical professionals can make informed choices without prolonged manual analysis, thus optimizing ICU resource utilization.
